                        <p>Since the dawn of transactions, their has always been a "Middle-man", but as systems developed, so did they. These middlemen have been controlling the flow and access of various forms of data. For instance, Facebook is the middleman between users and advertisers. Banks are middlemen between borrowers and lenders.</p>
                        <p>The issue here is that the data is controlled by a central authority - Facebook and banks. They, therefore, control the prices and also technically own the data. In this scenario, all the power lies with a middleman and users have to trust them to remain ethical and continue to think about user interest. Blockchain was invented to make the data decentralized and trust minimized with any centralized party.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand it better, let us talk about torrents. In torrents, no file is owned by a single person. It is a kind of “peer-to-peer” architecture where multiple copies of the file are present at multiple workstations/users. Therefore, no single person controls that file. This kind of architecture is highly scalable and fault-tolerant since there is no single point of failure.</p>
                        <p>Blockchain essentially borrows the same idea: what if databases could be decentralized.</p>
                        <p>One of the well-known use cases of Blockchain is that of cryptocurrency which is a digital currency that isn’t controlled by any central authority. Similarly, we can use Blockchain for smart digital contracts where no middleman is verifying the contract.</p>
                        <p>So in Summary:</p>
                        <p>Think of Blockchain as a distributed and secured data structure that can be used in places where no middlemen are involved. The decentralized nature of Blockchain is what helps in removing the middlemen and it comes from the above immutability of Blockchain. It is an interesting data structure and as we all have seen cryptocurrency is a real-life implementation of it.</p>

                        <p>I might be a newbie in the Software Development field, but in the last 4 months, I've learned so much about coding, that even I can't believe what I'm capable of. To be honest, 5 months ago, if someone had told me "You are going make your very first website in 4 months!", I would've never guessed that it would look even remotely this good.</p>
                        <p>I attended Lyceum International School where I completed my A-Levels in the science stream. My primary objective was to pursue an education in the field of Psychology, however, during the emergence of the current pandemic, many universities had halted the acceptance of new students. During this, I decided that, rather than just sitting around waiting, I'd be a bit more productive and get a temporary job.</p>
                        <p>During my time working at a well-reputed bank, I was fortunate enough to meet various individuals from a variety of industries. Furthermore, I also gained insight into what types of businesses were affected by the prevalent pandemic, and let me just say, that it wasn't all unpleasant. In reality, certain industries had been practically thriving in all this chaos.</p>
                        <p>One such profession was, in fact, Software Engineering and Development. I observed that amidst all the crises, IT companies actually increased in popularity. From small proprietors wanting to move their business online to people, yearning for that new game to alleviate the quarantine boredom, not only are current IT companies flourishing but also a plethora of new companies were emerging to build their empire within the Market. In addition to this, the whole work from home scenario only strengthened their foundation, because it increased employee satisfaction and performance while also cutting for on major utility expenses.</p>
                        <p>This epiphany is what led to my interest in pursuing a career in this field. I mean, a stable career, highly rewarding, and great employee satisfaction! What more could you want! I then did some research into how I could get started and that's when I came across the Bachelor's in Software engineering degree conducted by the Informatics Institute of Technology(IIT). They also conducted a scholarship program, in which I was fortunate enough to obtain a seat. As of now, I have successfully completed the Industrial training course offered by IIT and I'm well on my way to becoming a person that everyone close to me could be proud of.</p>
